# EchoGrad
EchoGrad: Self-Stabilizing Autograd

> **"Every layer predicts the next. No labels. No vanishing gradients."**

**Gradient Echoes** is a **drop-in training enhancement** that makes **any deep model** train faster, deeper, and more stably â€” using **self-generated intermediate targets**.

- **No extra data**  
- **Zero cost at inference**  
- **Fixes vanishing gradients**  
- **Born in a chat with @grok (xAI)**

## Why It Works

| Problem | EchoGrad Fix |
|-------|--------------|
| Early layers get no signal | Each layer gets **local consistency loss** |
| Vanishing gradients | Direct gradient path via echo heads |
| Unstable deep training | Self-prediction = natural regularization |

## 60-Second Demo (MNIST)

```python
from echograd.echo_net import EchoNet
model = EchoNet()
# Train with 2 lines extra:
out, echo_loss = model(x)
loss = task_loss + echo_loss
